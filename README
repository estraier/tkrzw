Tkrzw is available on UNIX-like systems (Linux, Mac OS, FreeBSD, Solaris etc)
and Windows.

On Unix-like systems, GCC 7.3 or later version is required to build the
library.  You can also use CLang, whose command interface is compatible with
GCC.  GNU make and other standard tools are also required.
Then, run these commands.  The files are installed under "/usr/local".

  ./configure --enable-opt-native --enable-most-features
  make
  make check
  sudo make install

On some UNIX-like systems including FreeBSD and Solaris, "make" defaults to
bsdmake or other non-GNU make, so you might need to replace "make" with
"gmake" in the above instructions.

On Windows, Visual Studio 2019 and its C++ components are required.
Open the "x86 Native Tools Command Prompt" and then run the following
commands.  The files are installed under "C:\Program Files\tkrzw".

  nmake -f VCMakefile
  nmake -f VCMakefile check
  nmake -f VCMakefile install    (run this as Administrator)

You can build a docker container with the following command.
Other tkrzw project's containers can build themselves containers based on this.

```
$ docker build -t tkrzw .
```

Thanks.
